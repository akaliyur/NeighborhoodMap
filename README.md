# Neighborhood Map Project

##  About the project
I have developed a single-page application featuring a map of a neighborhood. I've added additional functionality to this application, including map markers to identify popular locations or places, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations. Finally, I've researched and implemented third-party APIs (here: Zomato) that provide additional information about each of these locations (such as restaurant address, average cost for two people, restaurant rating, restaurant cuisines).
